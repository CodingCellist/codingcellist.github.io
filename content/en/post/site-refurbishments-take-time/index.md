I still like the idea of Digital Gardens which, since I posted
[the plan to make this website one](/en/post/project-garden-part-1/),
I have discovered are an entire sub-culture of websites. And as I've read more
about these, what they are, and what the philosophy behind them are --- slow,
imperfect, small changes, which accumulate into something nice over time ---
I've also realised/decided that changing my website to try this different
approach to online content will require taking the "gardening" approach to the
switch itself. Small, gradual changes; otherwise I'll never get it done. (It
takes time to rebuild a website, who knew?  ^^)

As part of exploring what this idea looks like, I managed to find the original
website which inspired me to try this:

* [Pete Millspaugh's garden](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/garden)
  - I absolutely adore the little light bulb on a string to change between light
      and dark mode!

As well as an essay and mission statement, of sorts, on digital gardening:

* [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

And finally, some other people's gardens that I really like the look of (in
addition to the 2 I just referenced):

* [Nikita Voloboev's Knowledge Wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/)
* [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
* [manunamz's WikiBonsai project](https://github.com/wikibonsai/wikibonsai)
  - I seriously considered migrating my site to this, I love the little "tree"
      network visualisation of different tags. But in the end, I sort of want to
      make my own and stick to Hugo, which is what I'm currently using. This may
      very well end up being a ton more work than I think, but hopefully it'll
      be educational  ^^;;
* and [the Jekyll-version demo of WikiBonsai](https://jekyll-wikibonsai.netlify.app/)

Inspired by all these things, here's the first little change: categories and
graphical labels, aka. emojis, for these (you may have noticed that this post is
in the category "shoot")

* :beans: **seed** --- Seeds are things which I intend to write, but haven't
    gotten beyond the prototyping/bullet-point/ideation stage. I'll try my best
    to have these on the website, so that people can see what I'm up to and
    thinking about; usually, until now, they have lived in a little green
    Leuchturm-notebook. Annoyingly, there is no seed emoji, so beans will have
    to do.
* :seedling: **sprout** --- Sprouts are the start of something bigger, like a
    full-blown blog post/essay (more on those shortly), but in its early stages.
    I expect these to be more expanded, paragraph-like bullet-points, but
    without the flow and structuring that a complete post has.
* :herb: **shoot** --- Shoots are works which might be done, but need another
    look through (or don't). Maybe there are some details which need
    clarification, or some sections need moving around, or similar. Or maybe I
    just decide that they're actually fine, and nothing needs adjusting. I'm not
    quite happy with the name "shoot", so that may change if I find a better
    term.
* :potted_plant: **succulent** --- There is no succulent emoji! A travesty!
    Anyway. Succulents are little tips and tricks which are not quite big enough
    to warrant their own post. Quite often I stumble upon little command-line
    tools, neat tricks, and other "today-I-learned" kind of things, and these
    will be little potted ~~succulents~~ plants. (I may very well rectify this
    grave injustice and create my own little cute succulent emoji to make the
    world right ^^)
* :evergreen_tree: **evergreen** --- These are the finished and polished
    posts, essays, tutorials, what have you. Although the name "evergreen"
    suggests that they never need adjusting, that's will vary depending on the
    post (for example, my Arch Linux install guide definitely needs tending by
    now; oops), and so I might still change these from time to time.
