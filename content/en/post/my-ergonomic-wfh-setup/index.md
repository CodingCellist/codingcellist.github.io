title: "My Ergonomic WFH Setup"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Throughout my degree in CS, I have become increasingly aware of and
          interested in computer ergonomics. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading
          to working from home and a lot more online interactions, I decided to
          properly look into things and get set up."

It is kind of hard to avoid using a computer when your degree+PhD is in Computer
Science, I probably use my computer at least 8 hours per day for work. Add to
that the fact that, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (let's hope
specifying _which_ pandemic never becomes relevant), a lot of the things I do in
my downtime typically also involve using a computer (video games, chatting with
friends, watching series/movies, etc). With all of this, I have become
increasingly interested in computer ergonomics and the negative health effects
of intensive computer use.

There are numerous stories (at least amongst the people I talk to) about someone
who knows a friend/colleague, or a friend of a friend, who have had to take time
off or get a some specific setup due to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Repetitive
Strain Injury (RSI), wrist pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, bad posture, you name
it! There are also numerous studies (e.g. [[1](#references), [2](#references),
[3](#references), [4](#references), [5](#references), [6](#references)]) which
have discovered or suggested links between prolonged computer use and some of
these issues.

So with all these things in mind, and the pandemic providing the spark to
actually start looking, I decided I would try to minimise the risk / optimise
the comfort of my working environment _before_ I noticed any severe issues.


### Fixing working from a laptop

If 


### A more ergonomic mouse

The next thing was to pick an ergonomic mouse


### Picking an ergonomic keyboard

Ergonomic computer peripherals are a niche-ish market, so I foolishly assumed
that there would only be a couple of choices. I was wrong; there are so many
options! And each have their strengths and weaknesses. Like choosing a Linux
distro, choosing a laptop, choosing headphones, choosing anything really, the
amount of choice can be overwhelming and slightly paralysing; it is easy to
drown in the amount of research which seems to be needed just to know enough to
start knowing what the differences are.

However, I narrowed my search space slightly: I type on an ISO keyboard layout,
ideally with Nordic legends, and I prefer mechanical keyboards. Since the
North American market is just so big, most keyboards come in ANSI layout,
especially more niche products like ergonomic keyboards, so wanting an ISO
layout immediately somewhat reduced my options.
