- box is not very tall! 6.8 cm! That's promising!
- having seen prototype pictures, it is really cool to see the box in person.
- keycaps in reusable containers (packed _tight_):
  * fun faces (great choice of typeface ^^)
  * Danish/Nordic specific
  * Along with German and British specifics
  * Missing: `2 " @`, `3 # £` (although it's very similar to US 3), `4 ¤ $`?
    - Mostly miffed about the `2 " @`, since that's a really big difference with
        commonly used characters.
- Anyway, on to actual keyboard?
- Not quite yet: hidden compartments inside each half! USB A-to-C cable;
    threads, bolts, and mini-wrench for tenting; spacers, extra feet, and keycap
    puller; USB A-to-2×C
- Keyboard:
  * Compact and elegant.
  * Portability is very important for me.
    - 278g per side
    - to help contextualise that, Zen is 138g per side, a pair of Bose QC25s is
        450g, and the left and right halves of an ISO Dygma Raise is roughly
        600g and 700g respectively! No wonder my shoulders hated me back when I
        was lugging that around...
    - When comparing with the Zen, it is worth remembering that the Glove80 has
        almost twice as many keys as the Zen per side (40 vs 21), so having the
        keyboard's mass be almost exactly twice seems fair enough (impressive
        even, since the Glove is made of plastic, whereas the Zen has an
        aluminium top-plate.
  * Decently tented without adjustment. This was mentioned in the FAQ or Discord
      at some point, but again, seeing it in person is different.
  * Hand size: ~17cm from base of palm to tip of middle finger, 13.5cm from base
      of palm to tip of pinky
  * I'll need to slightly adjust a habit, because my hands naturally rest at
      bottom of palm-rest, making them rest at m-,-.-- row.
  * I've been using the Zen for the past month, which is a 42-key keyboard, so I
      initially felt things were far away. But it's just a question of
      adjusting. The bottom 4 rows are easy and comfortable to reach, numbers is
      a bit of a stretch, and function keys require me to move my hand up a bit
      (but less than a regular keyboard, mind you).
  * N.B. Can't reach 0 with pinky... And forget about `- _`, and `F10`
  * Speaking of F-keys: don't mind the cut-out key. It would be similarly out of
      reach for me, so if that's the cost to get the height down, that's a-OK by
      me.
  * The elevated pinky rows are great, and so much more comfortable than had
      they been lower. However, they reveal that there are "bad" habits that _do
      not work_ on the Glove. Your ring finger can technically reach the 'P'
      key, but it's not comfortable nor easy.
  * The closest 4 thumbkeys are comfortably in reach, bottom row is closest for
      my hand/typing position. Bottom-furthest is a stretch, but doable. And
      top-furthest requires moving the hand.
- The keyboard feels very stable, even when "hammering" the keys.
- Rubber feet are good at preventing the thing from sliding around.
- The thumb screws for palm rests needed loosening with a screwdriver.
    Captive, and spring-loaded, which is really nice. It's a bit lighter without
    palm rests, but I'll be using mine with, the comfort is much better in my
    opinion.


## Closing remarks

- Some personal adjustments needed for first keyboard with key well
- I'm going to experiment with the tenting and layouts over the coming weeks,
    taking a similar approach of "this is my only keyboard now" and seeing how
    that goes. I'll try to report back in about a month, but life has a tendency
    of getting in the way of me being able to write blog entries, so we'll see
    about that.
- My partner had a brief try and said it would take some getting used to; she
    can touch-type fine, but the three-dimensionality of the keyboard was
    confusing to her and meant she needed to look at the keys to know what
    letters they were on. This is probably worth bearing in mind if you would be
    switching from a good old standard flat keyboard. To add another data-point
    though, the keys were comfortably in-reach for her as well, with a hand size
    of 16cm (palm base to tip of middle finger)
