- ~17cm from base of palm to tip of middle finger
- 13.5cm from base of palm to tip of pinky
- box is not very tall! 6.8 cm! That's promising!
- having seen prototype pictures, it is really cool to see the box in-person.
- keycaps in reusable containers (packed _tight_):
  * fun faces (great choice of typeface ^^)
  * Danish/Nordic specific
  * along with German and British specifics
  * missing: `2 " @`, `3 # £` (not bad, very similar) to US 3, `4 ¤ $`?
- anyway, on to actual keyboard?
- not quite yet: hidden compartments inside each half! USB A-to-C cable;
    threads, bolts, and mini-wrench for tenting; spacers, extra feet, and keycap
    puller; USB A-to-2×C
- keyboard:
  * Compact and elegant.
  * Decently tented without adjustment. This was mentioned in the FAQ or Discord
      at some point, but again, seeing it in-person is different.
  * I'll need to slightly adjust a habit, because my hands naturally rest at
      bottom of palm-rest, making them rest at m-,-.-- row.
  * Bottom 4 rows are easy to reach, numbers is a bit of a stretch, function
      keys are out of reach without moving hand
  * N.B. Can't reach 0 with pinky... And forget about `- _`, and `F10`
  * Speaking of F-keys: don't mind the cut-out key. It would be similarly out of
      reach for me, so if that's the cost to get the height down, that's a-OK by
      me.
  * The elevated pinky rows are great, and so much more comfortable than had
      they been lower. However, they reveal that there are "bad" habits that _do
      not work_ on the Glove. Your ring finger can technically reach the 'P'
      key, but it's not comfortable nor easy.
  * The closest 4 thumbkeys are comfortably in reach, bottom row is closest for
      my hand/typing position. Bottom-furthest is a stretch, but doable. And
      top-furthest requires moving the hand.

## Adjusting

- Keycaps: TODO
- Tenting: TODO (My personal preference is more tented [...])
