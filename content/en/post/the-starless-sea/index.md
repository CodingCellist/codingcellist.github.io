Reading "The Starless Sea" is like watching an intricately put-together puzzle
unfold and reveal its workings. There are stories within stories, fables, bits,
and quotes, all of which initially seem unrelated, but weave in and out of each
other, enhancing, revealing, exploring, detailing various facets of the story
and its characters. It's amazingly written, and so fun to explore! It took me a
bit to get going, but once it got going, every new story, every context-switch
went from "Huh?" to "Ooh, I wonder where this fits in!" -- And you can try to
guess those parts as well; to connect the dots yourself  : D

One of the cover reviews is "The Starless Sea rejects older stories: it makes
its own." And it really does! I would probably describe the book as a
love-letter to story telling, fables, and literary analysis. But it is also just
a solid story of intrigue, mystery, secret societies, hidden spaces, etc., which
it's very easy to get dragged into.

It took me longer to read than books normally do. I can't pinpoint if it was
because of the vocabulary or the context-switches, or if the book's print is
smaller than normal, or some combination of all of this (or something
different). But in a way, it felt very appropriate; The Starless Sea took its
time to show and guide and reveal its world, and where it was going with it.

If you like Dark Academia, mystery, and intrigue, mixed in with a sprinkle of
discussion / exploration on what stories and their purpose are (not done in a
pretentious way, I promise!), then I'd strongly recommend reading The Starless
Sea! It's such great fun to see all the pieces slowly but surely come together,
and to explore the world via some very sweet and well-written characters  : )

(Oh and there is definitely going to be some re-reading value, so if you're into
that, that's neat as well.)

As always, thanks for reading. Have a great day!  : )
