At the time of writing, I have been using the Dygma Raise for about a year and a
half. I use it pretty much daily for about 8-10 hours, albeit less on the
weekends, where I prefer to see the outside (strange, I know). I thought it
might be good to put my thoughts and experience out there, in case someone else
is considering buying this keyboard.

If you're wondering why I chose this keyboard specifically, there's a more
in-depth discussion of my considerations
[here](/en/post/my-ergonomic-wfh-setup#picking-an-ergonomic-keyboard), but the
tl;dr is: It was a mechanical keyboard which had a model with Nordic ISO layout
and backlighting; based on
[their YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/EoNkMBY7qKI), the thumb buttons seemed
well thought-through; and the hardware, firmware, and config software being
open-source is something I find cool and wanted to support.

### A year without tenting
If you thought this was anything other than the angle between the keyboard and
the table, get your mind out of the gutter!

The Raise Keyboard initially came as just a split keyboard; there were no
accessories to adjust the angle of the keyboard relative to the table. After
numerous requests from the community, however, Dygma released the "Raise Tenting
Kit": A set of plates which could be screwed onto the bottom of the keyboard and
allowed it to be tented at angles of 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40°.

I was initially skeptical of whether tenting made a difference. Having used
"flat"/normal keyboard orientations my whole life, I suspected the main
difference was getting the split keyboard (since that aligned my keyboard with
my shoulder-width) and that tenting might be too weird or uncomfortable.
Nevertheless, I ended up taking a similar approach to tenting as I originally
did with learning Vim: a lot of people seem to like this, so there must be
something about it, and  ordered a white kit to match my keyboard. I did also
come across the term "wrist pronation" in the
[ShortCircuit video](https://youtu.be/i4TCbc9oB1E?t=298) discussing the Raise,
and (looking further into this) it seemed to be a real issue and one which
