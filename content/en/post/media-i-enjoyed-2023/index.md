Another year has passed, and I've enjoyed lots of different varieties and kinds
of media throughout it. In a perfect world, I would want to write a full blog
post on each of the things mentioned here, but in this annoyingly imperfect
world with silly limitations like 24 hours in a day and the need for sleep, this
will do. I hope you enjoy this little collection of things, and maybe even find
something you want to pick up yourself. Happy New Year!  : )

(Note: this is not meant to be read in one go, it is meant to be jumped around
in. Hopefully the Table of Contents can help you go to whichever topic or
specific instance strikes your fancy.)

## Music

Overall, I've continued to explore the amazing, slightly melancholic and
bittersweet world of post-rock. It strikes a special chord with me, though I
can't quite explain why. Sad yet comforting; maybe you know the feeling, or
maybe I'm just talking nonsense. Anyway, here's ~~wonderwall~~ some album/band
recommendations:

### Solkyri

Solkyri was a band I had never heard of, but they opened for We Lost The Sea on
tour this year. Opening bands can be hit or miss, in my experience, but Solkyri
were really solid and I'll be trying to catch them live in the future when I
have the opportunity to.

I've acquired 2 of their albums so far:

* "Mount Pleasant", which is their most recent album and hence also the one they
    played more tracks from at the concert. "Pendock and Progress" was their
    opening track at the concert, and is really nice. Bit more of a guitar solo
    feel than most post-rock tracks, and the album in general feels a bit more
    grunge/alt-rock (maybe? I'm not super good with genres), but it is a good
    album and one that I keep coming back to several months after the concert
    happened.
* "Are You My Brother?" is an older (2013) album of theirs. It is more
    classic/soft post-rock, which I personally really like. I find myself
    reaching for it whenever I want something nice, uplifting, and relaxing,
    whilst still being post-rock (so not too relaxing, I guess ^^). There is one
    track with vocals, which some post-rock fans will like and some won't; I
    quite like both that track, and the album in general.

### Drif (Heilung)

Heilung is a fun and somewhat esoteric band. I was introduced to their music via
the video game "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" --- a Viking-/Old-Norse-inspired,
story-driven hack-n-slash --- and have since found myself enjoying the music a
lot more than I expected. "Drif" is their most recent album, and although the
poetry readings are somewhat weird (but there's only one or two of them), it
brings a different, more evolved sound to previous albums like "Lifa". If you're
interested in trying something new; something which plausibly sounds like it
could have been coming from the haar-covered shores before a raid, or
sang/chanted at some old Germanic ritual (Heilung themselves calls their style
"amplified history") --- without the neo-n*zi associations which unfortunately
also tend to come with that style of things --- then give Heilung a try.
(Heilung, as far as I can tell, have been very good at removing fans which do
not follow the first line of their Opening Ceremony: "Remember that we all are
brothers".)

I'd recommend starting with "Lifa" or maybe the 2 first tracks on "Drif". 

### My Little, Safe Space (Six Days of Rest)

This premiered on the WorldHasPostRock YouTube channel about a month ago. Then
December hit, and as a result I've not had much time to listen to it beyond
that. The first impressions I've gotten from the couple of listens I've given it
though, is that it's a quite calm album, perfect for evening listening or when
you need to ground yourself. There _is_ a slightly more restless section (a bit
like sitting trying to calm down in a little, safe space ; )), but I don't mind
that; it adds depth to the album.

### ÁTTA (Sigur Rós)

ÁTTA, 8 in Icelandic, is the latest album by post-rock legends Sigur Rós. It is
a very fleeting and drifty album, a departure from their previous couple of
albums, which have used a lot of distortion. If you're familiar with Sigur Rós,
ÁTTA is a bit like () but with a more generally uplifting sound and more piano.
The fourth track, "Klettur", builds up these absolutely fantastic small tensions
using dissonance, and then the chorus resolves them all with a beautiful harmony
that just washes over you; it's phenomenal!

ÁTTA can be listened to both in the background and in a more focused session,
and in both cases, I've found, leaves you feeling refreshed and at least a bit
happier.

### Triumph & Disaster (We Lost The Sea)

We Lost The Sea (WLTS) were my first introduction to post-rock (the YouTube
channel "WorldHasPostRock" included "A Gallant Gentlemen" as part of one of
their collections) and I don't think I've loved a genre that fast in a long
time.

Now. Where "Departure Songs" was an album inspired by the perseverance and
enduring curiosity of humanity in spite of extreme risk and tragic accidents,
making the album highly cathartic and comforting in its own bittersweet
post-rock way, "Triumph & Disaster" is not exactly that. The opening paragraph
of the album description reads:

> Triumph & Disaster is a post-apocalyptic view on the collapse of the world
> told like a children’s story and illustrated through the eyes of a mother and
> her son as they spend one last day on Earth. The music is the narrative for
> the destruction and tragedy. The words tell the story of love, loss and
> letting go. 

If that immediately brought your mood down, yeah it tends to have that effect
(sorry!). Triumph & Disaster is an intense album, to say the least, both
thematically and musically. The very first notes on the album are harsh, almost
air-siren-like (but make it metal), and they slowly fade in and out of the music
for _seven minutes_ of the first track (which is 15 minutes long; I love this
genre ^^). On one hand, it's somewhat jarring. But on the other, as ever with
WLTS, boy does it ever nicely set the tone for the rest of the album's
"journey".

That's not to say that there aren't nice tracks on the album, far from it! The
remaining half of the first track is softer (although the opening harshness does
make a comeback towards the end of the track), and this is a common theme
throughout the album. There are some soft tracks in the middle of it, but most
of the tracks blend post-rock and that more metal-y harshness; the album tells a
tragic, haunting narrative, and the music reflects that. It's actually really
cool.

I love this album, I genuinely do, but the intensity of its story, how the music
tells it, and the at times overwhelming soundscape means it is not something I
listen to lightly, in the background. And I often need to just sit for a bit
after listening to it. It's a tragic story, but it's just so well done...

Reading back over that, if I've somehow convinced you to listen to this (because
it is actually fantastic music) rather than you just going "I'm good. Do you
need a hug?", then yay!  ^^;;

Also, be sure to listen to the combination of the album's poem/story and the
track "Dust", on YouTube: "Triumph & Disaster - Are we really too late?" This
combination is not included on the album (I don't know why, it is such a good
way to go through the album's accompanying text), but it is once again really
well done and sets the tone for the album.

### Miscellaneous

Other than the post-rock albums, I have (re-)discovered some old bands and
albums from various genres:

* **Some Nights (Fun.)** --- I'd only ever heard the singles, but the entire
    album is great; parts of it remind me a bit of Queen.
* **Black Holes and Revelations (Muse)** --- I'd heard of, but never listened
    to, Muse. I'm not entirely sure how I first encountered some of the tracks
    on this album, but I have now bought it and am thoroughly enjoying it.
    There's a good mix of rock, synths, rhythm, and slow songs.
* **Take-off Your Pants and Jacket (Blink-182)** --- A long-lost classic. I was a
    huge Avril Lavigne fan growing up, so I have a soft spot for pop-punk. Being
    older, it is obviously "some young men with attitude", but the music is
    still good and fun.
* **Metallica [The Black Album] (Metallica)** --- I got into Metallica via the
    phenomenal cello-covers by Apocalyptica. Finally decided to listen to some
    of the originals, and ended up liking the songs, including the ones I hadn't
    heard, so much that I bought the album.
* **Extreme Power Metal** (Dragonforce) --- I decided to revisit Dragonforce,
    which I hadn't listened to since the "Inhuman Rampage" and "Guitar Hero III"
    days (2007; aaaah!), and was pleasantly surprised. Their songs are still
    undeniably power metal: mainly fast guitars, drums, and solos, but I found
    the songs on "Extreme Power Metal" to be more distinguishable from each
    other than the ones on "Inhuman Rampage" were. Always nice to see a band has
    evolved and refined its sound, and this album is now my go-to whenever I
    need a ridiculous burst of energy (although listening to it while already
    stressed/anxious is not good, it turns out). I did not see a cover of "My
    Heart Will Go On" coming, but I'm here for it  ^^


## Video Games

Acquiring a Steam Deck around New Year's 2022-2023 has been a game changer (heh)
in terms of me actually relaxing and playing video games, rather than using my
laptop, which is also my work device, and ending up stressed and not knowing
what to play. The Deck is easy to take out and take with you; it does media
playback thanks to actually being a complete Linux "laptop" in disguise; and
with a dock, wireless mouse and keyboard, and an external DVD/BluRay drive, it
even works as a media PC. Sure, you're not going to play competitive Counter
Strike or DotA2 on it, but for everything else, it's fantastic and runs any game
I've thrown at it surprisingly well.

And here are some games I enjoyed playing on it:

### Sayonara Wild Hearts

<details>

<summary>Epilepsy disclaimer</summary>

If you have some form of photosensitive epilepsy, I'm really sorry to say that
it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to play Sayonara Wild Hearts. The
game _heavily_ uses strobing and flashing lights in various neon colours, often
contrasting ones (for example flashing bright orange on top of a generally
purple scene), to an extent that might make some non-epilepsy-sensitive people
dazed. And there are sadly no settings or mods which change this. I'm genuinely
sad about this, because it has both great gameplay and music, and I wish more
people could experience the game...

</details>

"Sayonara Wild Hearts" I found via an Architect of Games recommendation video.
I picked it up not knowing what to expect, other than other people liking it and
it being an indie game (which usually is indicative of a
fun/fresh/interesting/good/all-of-the-above game). And wow did it ever deliver!
Sayonara Wild Hearts can only be described as so. much. _raw. **fun!**_

The game is an interactive album with a neon-purple and -pink
vaporwave/cyberpunk colour scheme. The music is _fantastic_. Go listen to the
opening/menu track "Sayonara Wild Heart" by Daniel Olsén, and if you like the
beat, if you find that track fun, if you get hyped, then go pick up the game
right now and come back once you've stopped grinning from playing it ^^

The whole game _pulses_ with energy to the beat, the music is simply fun, no
other way to describe it, and the gameplay mechanics and scenarios constantly
surprise you in the best of ways. You drift through space, skate along a
breaking-up motorway, fly through meteors; and I'll stop there because I'll
spoil too many things which are best when freshly experienced. It is a rhythm
game at its core, but not a difficult one, and the game constantly introduces
new mechanics and then takes them away before they become boring, giving it a
great drive.  Sayonara Wild Hearts was the first time in forever that I found
myself grinning from ear to ear within minutes. And that lasted throughout the
game.

I have over 20 hours in this game which is effectively a 1-hour-ish interactive
album. And although I love the music, the vast majority of those hours are
because the gameplay is such fun to revisit!

### The Past Within

For anyone familiar with the Rusty Lake game studio and their unnerving, noir
puzzle games, "The Past Within" is yet another wonderful instalment in the
series. It requires 2 players on separate devices (with 2 separate copies of the
game), making it ideal for playing whilst hanging out with a partner or
puzzle-liking friend.

You return to your father's old cabin by the lake to explore his lab and solve
the puzzles to potentially bring him back, whatever that may mean. One player is
in the past of the setting and another in the present, and you must communicate
what you see on your screen to solve the puzzles; very simple, fun, and
collaborative. A game takes probably 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your
communication skills and puzzle-solving-ability, and since there are multiple
puzzles and sides to the story, it is also replayable.  Well worth the £7 or so
that it is on Steam.

### Signalis

Signalis was another game that I received on recommendation of the Architect of
Games YouTube channel. And I should have read the tags: it's a Lovecraftian
survival horror game, not "something fun" to start one random evening... ^^;;

Oh well. The game itself is interesting, although the story requires some
familiarity with works like "The King in Yellow" and other eldritch/weird horror
stories, and thought and interpretation/analysis. You play as Elster, an "LSTR
unit", searching for her missing companion after their ship crashed on a remote
planet with an underground mining operation. However, (surprise surprise) the
mine seems abandoned, and as you travel further down you begin to encounter its
former workers, which are different types of units, who have turned into
monsters.

> Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and
> things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.

You do not have much health, and the game only lets you carry 6 items in your
inventory at any time (there are synchronised storage crates in safe-rooms, for
storing extra items and swapping loadouts), making it an interesting challenge
balancing healing items, weapons, ammunition, and the strategies you want to
employ when traversing the mining complex. The sound design is fabulously
unnerving (there are tunable radios), and the plot equally so. If you're looking
for a different type of game and don't mind the horror aspects, Signalis is
probably for you.

### Celeste

Celeste is an incredibly highly acclaimed puzzle-platformer. It was released in
2018, but I returned to it this year to play through it with more dedication
than I had previously. Not only did I end up completing the game, but I managed
to get obsessed enough to hunt 100% of its achievements.

The game is probably as close to perfect as games can get, genuinely. The
soundtrack, story, level design, and characters are woven together so nicely,
complementing each other in different ways and by different amounts depending on
the stage in each chapter (level), that the flow of the game is unlike anything
else I've experienced.

Celeste is about the main character, Madeline, trying to climb Celeste mountain,
mainly just to prove that she can. But it quickly becomes clear that the
mountain is more than it lets on, as the game takes the player through an
extremely well-written story exploring anxiety, mental health, depression,
tenacity, pressure, and dealing with one's inner demons. And it manages to do
this without any of it feeling forced or corny; it all feels very honest.

The game is very challenging, but exemplary in accessibility settings: the game
speed, player stamina, number of dashes, etc. can all be configured in case the
default difficulty is too high. And there is no judgement here: you can still
earn all the achievements, complete the story, and do the optional challenges as
you would with the default difficulty. Celeste is meant to be a hard game, but
"challenging" means drastically different things for different people; why
exclude some? You can always leave it off or turn it back up if you find it
being too easy or want to try the defaults after you've gotten used to your
personal settings.

Each level is also very fair. Nothing requires pixel-perfect timing or anything
like that. This can lead to some frustration, as every death means you know
pretty much exactly what you did wrong. But that makes it so much more fun and
satisfying when you finally get a room done  : )

There's plenty of bonus, more challenging, content once the base story has been
completed. And finally, there is the free Chapter 9 DLC: "Farewell". It is the
final challenge for fans of the game, and even though it took me almost as long
to beat that single chapter as it did the rest of the game and bonus content
combined, I played it through a second time, just because it flows _so well_ and
blends story, music, and gameplay exquisitely!

### Hades

I really wanted to like "Hades"; I've played previous Supergiant games and
thoroughly enjoyed their stories and gameplay. However, I found Hades' final
boss, and the way to reach it, somewhat arbitrary in difficulty (maybe I just
need to "git gud"). And while I _am_ interested in what the story is and how the
relationships between the characters develop, I am not interested enough
compared to the overall difficulty that I want to clear the game at least 6
times --- once with each weapon --- along with extra clears to get the random
encounter for the tens of supporting characters, in order to get a complete
picture of what happened and how each character is. Which is a shame because it
_is_ a good story, and the voice actors they've hired have done a spectacular
job of their roles (did I mention every character is voiced? No? It's pretty
cool!). But again, maybe I just need to "git gud". And if you like difficult
rogue-likes, Hades might very well be for you.

### Alba: A Wildlife Adventure

"Alba" is a stylised, cute, and peaceful video game about the girl Alba spending
her summer holiday with her grandparents on a Mediterranean island. You go
around exploring the local wildlife, as well as talk to the locals about things
like the mayor's plan to build a mega-hotel on the island (which is really
nicely portrayed as a nuanced issue, not purely evil). The game is incredibly
immersive with a lot of attention to tiny details that aren't immediately
obvious, because your brain just accepts them as "how the world works"; that's
how seamlessly they're implemented.

The buildings are unquestionably Mediterranean in architecture, with slightly
boxy houses in town and  houses with tiled roofs and white walls surrounding
them in the residential area just on the outskirts of town. There is a constant
background noise of grasshoppers and cicadas as well, which anyone who has been
to the Mediterranean in the summer will recognise. And all of that, combined
with the deep blue sky, bright sun in the day, and warm tint in the evenings,
really make you believe you're on a small Mediterranean island.

The crowning jewel of Alba, in my opinion, is its sound design: the people
behind that _clearly_ studied a lot of birds. The wood pigeons coo from up in
trees or gutters, the distant cries of swifts descend from high in the sky,
great tits chirp, oystercatchers have their distinctive cry; you can essentially
locate any bird if you happen to hear its call. The game conveys directional
audio really well, even on headphones or TV speakers, and since there's no
obvious cut-off distance, you are able to pin-point even distant bird calls.

Also, the animations are spot-on: swifts glide and very occasionally flap their
wings; swallows swoop; pigeons hop; seagulls glide and hop; smaller birds do
that silly little hop when they can't quite be bothered flying. And the main
character, Alba, who is a little girl (probably 8 or so) doesn't simply walk,
she skips and runs. At random! Like a kid would! It's really well done. (I know
I might sound overly enthusiastic here, but I do genuinely find it amazing how
much attention to detail there is in this game.) There are also some brutally
honest yes/no answers you get to give, in exactly the way a young child would.

At the end of the story, the game lets you explore freely, so there is no
pressure to complete the wildlife journal before you complete the story.  So
yeah, if you're looking for a cute little game to take you away on a relaxing
exploration of wildlife in the Mediterranean, Alba is an excellent "sit back and
relax"-game that is also fun to play. 

### Furi

Furi is an extremely challenging boss-rush game. It is probably the hardest game
I have played in many years. You play as a mysterious character locked up in a
high-security space prison, and you have to escape by fighting each section's
"Guardian". You have a sword (melee attack), a laser gun (ranged attack), a
dash/dodge, and a parry; nothing more, nothing less. And each boss requires you
to use these in different ways, adapting to that fighter's attack style and
patterns. There is a story, which is revealed throughout the fights, and the
ending when you finally break free is really well done. _It is very difficult
though,_ and more in a "raw difficulty" kind of way than, for example, Celeste or
Hollow Knight, both of which are tough but fair. An exercise in frustration at
times, but a fun one (if you're into those kinds of games ^^) with a really good
soundtrack and story.

(The camera angles in-between fights are completely wack however, and the game
not automatically readjusting your input-direction-transformation when the
camera angle changes (until you let go of the joystick) makes for a very
confusing experience. You _can_ manually walk through the scenery to the next
fight, but there is a toggle for auto-walking, and I would recommend using it as
often as possible. Fortunately this only applies in-between fights, the camera
behaviour during fights is sensible and almost static.)

### Control

I enjoyed "Control", a paranatural, SCP-inspired game about the main character
Jessie searching for her brother, who was taken by the mysterious "Federal
Bureau of Control". There are powers like hovering and telekinesis to play with,
combine with your gun-fu to get to enemies, and to use to explore previously
unreachable areas of the map. However, I found that the novelty of the powers
wore off fairly quickly, although the fights were pretty well-paced.

The game is playable on a Steam Deck, and I didn't mind the playthrough I got
out of it, nor the game's look on the Steam Deck. But there are so many
reflective surfaces, textured metal plates, and water puddles that the game was
clearly meant to be played on a GPU with dedicated ray tracing hardware. If you
have one of those, it probably looks _phenomenal_.

### Deep Rock Galactic

Deep Rock Galactic (DRG) is another game I didn't start in 2023, but still
warrants mentioning. "Danger, Darkness, Dwarves" is the description, and it
pretty much does what it says on the tin. You play as a dwarf on a space mining
rig, sent down in a crude "drop pod" to serve your corporate overlord's mining
interests, regardless of risk to your own life and limb. However, what makes
this game such a gem is how much it leans in to this otherwise depressing
setting: You're grumpy mining dwarves! _In space!_ Every line is voiced exactly
as I imagine a grumpy dwarf on a mining rig would sound, including the
management person who begrudgingly radios you your mission objectives and alerts
you when a swarm of bugs is on your way. Everything is themed around "fantasy
dwarf stereotypes, but make it space mining", and it makes for great
entertainment; the beers at the corporate bar is what give you your buffs before
each mission, for example! It's great! ^^

DRG can be played solo, although thanks to a very well-implemented ping system
(and the community being friendly in general) I have both joined random missions
and had strangers join my missions, and had a blast each time. There is also
voice chat, if you like that. By default the team size is 4, one for each class
(or a different sub-arrangement if you wish), although I hear that can be
adjusted with mods (which I assume then have to be installed for all players who
want to join).

**Rock and Stone!**


## Books

### Becky Chambers' books

Some years ago, a friend of mine recommended the first of the Becky Chambers
books: "The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet". I picked it up around Christmas
that year, read it in (I think) a day, and _immediately_ turned it over and
re-read it; it was that good.

It was sci-fi like I had never read before: intrictate, and with detailed
characters; amazing dialogue and interactions; refreshingly diverse species (as
in, not "Oh look! In this Milky Way of ours with literally billions of stars,
somehow every species is humanoid."); plot, scheming, secrets; glimpses of
technological and scientific explosions that were so cool and interesting, yet
didn't seem completely magic (for lack of a better term) or illogical. There's
also small sprinkles of anthropology throughout the books, and it makes for
highly entertaining musings on what "normal" is in a Galactic Commons context.

It's not a space opera; nobody is The Chosen One, destined to save The Universe
(tm). That might put some people off, and that's fair. But I personally found it
incredibly refreshing, and all the more enjoyable, to read and experience the
story of humans and aliens, and their interactions, which still felt relatable
and humane. The plot, conflicts, relationships, interactions, etc. weren't
grandiose, and yet they were. (Much in the same way as life, I guess.)

Anyway. I have since picked up each of the "Wayfarer" novels (of which "The Long
Way [...]" is the first), and although they are (mostly) independent and with
different casts, they are all wonderfully... cosy-whilst-thrilling, I think I'll
call it. Each one brings something fresh, a new idea / a new plot-point, meaning
I never felt like the stories were boring or simply expanding on existing story
for the sake of it.

Chambers' novella "Monk and Robot"-series are her more recent books, set in a
more solarpunk-esque world. But as always, the world-building is phenomenal:
there are fun new religions (like one whose symbol is a bear eating honey, and
the religion is focused on comfort and good food), an interesting world to
explore along with thoughts on AI, mortality, and (indirectly) the meaning of
life. Delightfully Zen.

At this point, I will pick up anything Becky Chambers publishes without
hesitation, and they're my go-to books for a nice afternoon in on a rainy day  :
)

### The House of Sorrowing Stars (Beth Cartwright)

There are a lot of good ideas in "The House of Sorrowing Stars", the core one
being an old house on a lake where people go to resolve their grief via special
flowers that only bloom when the grief has been processed. Each person's grief
is unique, leading to individual stories that must be told and processed in
their own way, and an individual amount of time spent by the person visiting the
house. It is a good setting. However, I personally found the book as a whole
somewhat disappointing.

The main character flees home, and this is never touched upon again, even though
she brings with her her father's craft (making marchpane) and her father
supports her decision to leave. One of the residents regrets not supporting his
son's passion, a similar situation to the starting position of the heroine, but
again, we never get to see how he eventually resolves this as part of processing
his grief. (In general, I would've liked to see more exploration of the idea of
how the house and flowers work.) The romance is also a bit iffy: the main
character wants to be independent and more than just "a pretty thing", yet she
gets shoe-horned into an insta-love with one of the permanent residents of the
house, without any rapport being built up or loosely established, to heal and
"fix" him, finding his violent outbursts of rage adoringly protective (or
something like that). Something is juts off about it; it felt misplaced and
awkward.

But such is any media consumption. As part of finding the good pieces, you
inevitably encounter duds or ones which seemed promising but disappoint.

### Monstress (Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda)

Okay, this one I've technically been following for 7 years, but I picked up
"Volume 8: Inferno" in November 2023 and it continues to be excellent. The art
is gorgeous, with clear inspiration from the Jugenstil/Art Nouveau and Art Déco
movements, mixed with a healthy amount of Steam Punk. Now, that wouldn't matter
too much if the story wasn't good. If you hadn't guessed, it thankfully is  ^^

It's got political plots, intrigue, and mystique; factions include a religious
cult, immortal demi-gods from an unknown world, talking cats with multiple tails
(and warrior-poets!), humans, and "arcanics", which are hybrid children of the
humans and the demi-gods. But no faction is perfect. There are internal
conflicts, corruption, all that good stuff that makes for really nice,
realistic, and deep storytelling about a world in a post-war, delicate state.
Everyone has a personal goal, and these don't just align out of convenience for
the story; it is much more interesting to explore the characters as they try to
reconcile differences. 

It also has one of the aspects I respect enormously in a story, especially one
set in a scheming, recently-post-war world: it doesn't shy away from hurting its
cast or main characters. Battles are fought, sieges are laid, sabotages are
conducted, and it is never "And the heroes made it because they're the heroes."
The fights are fair and realistic, with every dirty trick you would expect from
highly powerful, definitely-not-at-war factions applied. If a character would
lose a limb, they do. Characters which were introduced but run into an infernal
monster? They don't miraculously make it out, they die. And I respect that.

Tying into this, Monstress also nicely includes and handles the mental state of
its characters and how their psyche changes based on the events that they
encounter, the PTSD they (inevitably) develop from the turmoil they go through,
the choices they must make, and the events that affect them even though they
were outwith their control.

I'm looking forward to see where the story gets taken now that it seems it is
(sadly) reaching its endgame.

### The Infinity Particle (Wendy Xu)

On a completely different note to Monstress, "The Infinity Particle" is a strong
recommend to anyone who's familiar with the Becky Chambers novels and want
_more_. It's a sweet, but short, story set in a near-ish future on Mars, about a
tech intern, a human-like sentient robot, and narcissism (okay, that part is not
sweet, but it is key to the story). There are many interesting little thoughts
about what a world with conscious AI would be like, mutual respect in
relationships both platonic and non, as well as power structures. I think it
might be aimed at more of a young-adult audience, but it scratched that "cosy
space sci-fi" itch for me  : )

### The Three-Body Problem and The Dark Forest (Cixin Liu)

I have mixed feelings about these. They are good sci-fi novels (I think), and
they introduce interesting ideas about what First Contact might be like, discuss
human nature, etc. However, they also take a while to get going; for both books,
I've thought "When is anything going to happen" up until around page 100, but
then they really kick off! This might just be a difference in story-telling,
compared to all the British, Nordic, and USA-based sci-fi I have consumed up
until now, but, for example, in "The Dark Forest", when I was on the third page
of intricately describing an ant crawling over the inscription on a statue,
which it could never hope to understand, but still the shapes and corners and
curves said something about the world and the meaning of everything (and this
was done for at least 2-3 symbols on the statue), I really was tempted to skip
ahead to wherever the metaphor ended; a metaphor is fine, but I definitely got
it by the second time it was repeated, and the amount of detail used in each
repetition, I personally found, dragged it out unnecessarily.

Again, once they get going, they're really good. And maybe all it is, is a
difference in story-telling approaches. But I do wish they gripped you a bit
more at the start of the book, promised you something, rather than setting the
scene for over 100 pages.
