Another year has passed, and I've enjoyed lots of different varieties and kinds
of media throughout it. In a perfect world, I would want to write a full entry
on each of the things mentioned here, but in this annoyingly imperfect world
with silly limitations like ~24 hours in a day and the need for sleep, this will
do. I hope they're interesting and that you maybe even find something you want
to pick up yourself. Happy Holidays!  : )

### Becky Chambers' books

Some years ago, a friend of mine recommended the first of the Becky Chambers
books: "The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet". I picked it up around Christmas
that year, read it in (I think) a day, and _immediately_ turned it over and
re-read it; it was that good.

It was sci-fi like I had never read before: intrictate, and with detailed
characters; amazing dialogue and interactions; refreshingly diverse species (as
in, not "Oh look! In this Milky Way of ours with literally billions of stars,
somehow every species is humanoid."); plot, scheming, secrets; glimpses of
technological and scientific explosions that were so cool and interesting, yet
didn't seem completely magic (for lack of a better term) or illogical. There's
also small sprinkles of anthropology throughout the books, and it makes for
highly entertaining musings on what "normal" is, in an intergalactic commons
context.

It's not a space opera; nobody is The Chosen One, destined to save the universe
(tm). That might put some people off, and that's fair. But I personally found it
incredibly refreshing, and all the more enjoyable, to read and experience the
story of humans and aliens, and their interactions, that still felt relatable
and humane. The plot, conflicts, relationships, interactions, etc.  weren't
grandiose; and yet they were. (Much in the same way as life, I guess.)

Anyway. I have since picked up each of the "Wayfarer" novels (of which "The Long
Way [...]" is the first), and although they are (mostly) independent and with
different casts, they are all a wonderfully... cosy-whilst-thrilling, I think
I'll call it. And each one brings something fresh, a new idea / a new
plot-point, meaning I never felt like the stories were boring or "simply"
expanding on existing story for the sake of it.

Chambers' novella "Monk and Robot"-series are her more recent books, set in a
more solarpunk kind of world. But there are fun new religions (like one whose
symbol is a bear eating honey, and the religion is focused on comfort and good
food), an interesting world to explore along with thoughts on AI, mortality, and
(indirectly) the meaning of life. Delightfully Zen.

At this point, I will pick up anything she publishes without hesitation, and
they're my go-to books for a nice afternoon in on a rainy day  : )
