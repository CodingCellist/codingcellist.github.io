Another year has passed, and I've enjoyed lots of different varieties and kinds
of media throughout it. In a perfect world, I would want to write a full blog
post on each of the things mentioned here, but in this annoyingly imperfect
world with silly limitations like ~24 hours in a day and the need for sleep,
this will do. I hope you enjoy this little collection of things, and maybe even
find something you want to pick up yourself. Happy Holidays!  : )

## Music

In general, I've continued to explore the amazing, slightly melancholic and
bittersweet world of post-rock. It strikes a special chord with me, though I
can't quite explain why. Sad yet comforting; maybe you know the feeling, or
maybe I'm just talking nonsense. Anyway, here's ~~wonderwall~~ some album/band
recommendations:

### Solkyri

Solkyri was a band I had never heard of, but they opened for We Lost The Sea on
tour this year. Opening bands can be hit or miss, in my experience, but Solkyri
were really solid and I'll be trying to catch them live in the future when I
have the opportunity to.

I've acquired 2 of their albums so far:

* "Mount Pleasant", which is their most recent album and hence also the one they
    played more tracks from at the concert. "Pendock and Progress" was their
    opening track, and is great. Bit more of a guitar solo feel than most
    post-rock tracks, and the album in general feels a bit more grunge/alt-rock
    (maybe? I'm not super good with genres), but it is a really nice album and
    one that I keep coming back to several months after the concert happened.
* "Are You My Brother?" is an older (2013) album of theirs. It is more
    classic/soft post-rock, which I personally really like. I find myself
    reaching for it whenever I want something nice, uplifting, and relaxing,
    whilst still being post-rock (so not too relaxing, I guess ^^). There is one
    track with vocals, which some post-rock fans will like and some won't; I
    quite like it, and the album in general.

### Drif (Heilung)

Heilung is a fun and somewhat esoteric band. I was introduced to their music via
the video game "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" --- a Viking-/Old-Norse-inspired,
story driven hack 'n' slash --- and have since found myself enjoying the music a
lot more than I expected. "Drif" is their most recent album, and although the
poetry readings are somewhat weird (but there's only one of them), it brings a
different, more evolved sound to previous albums like "Lifa". If you're
interested in trying something new; something which plausibly sounds like it
could have been coming from the haar-covered shores before a raid, or
sang/chanted at some old Germanic ritual (Heilung themselves calls their style
"amplified history"); but without the neo-n*zi associations which unfortunately
also tend to come with that, then give Heilung a try. (Heilung, as far as I can
tell, have been very good at removing fans which do not follow the first line of
the 'Opening Ceremony': "Remember that we all are brothers".)

I'd recommend starting with "Lifa" or maybe the 2 first tracks on "Drif". 

### My Little, Safe Space (Six Days of Rest)

### ÁTTA (Sigur Rós)

### Triumph & Disaster (We Lost The Sea)

We Lost The Sea were my first introduction to post-rock (the YouTube channel
"WorldHasPostRock" included "A Gallant Gentlemen" as part of one of their
collections) and I don't think I've loved a genre that fast in a long time. So
they hold a special place in my heart.

Now. Where "Departure Songs" was an album inspired by the perseverance and
enduring curiosity of humanity in spite of extreme risk and tragic accidents,
making the album highly cathartic and comforting in its own bittersweet
post-rock way, "Triumph & Disaster" is not exactly that. The opening paragraph
of the album description reads:

> Triumph & Disaster is a post-apocalyptic view on the collapse of the world
> told like a children’s story and illustrated through the eyes of a mother and
> her son as they spend one last day on Earth. The music is the narrative for
> the destruction and tragedy. The words tell the story of love, loss and
> letting go. 

Now if that immediately brought your mood down, yeah it tends to have that
effect (sorry!). Triumph & Disaster is an intense album, to say the least, both
thematically and musically. The very first notes on the album are harsh, almost
air-siren-like (but make it metal), and they slowly fade in and out of the music
for _seven minutes_ of the first track (which is 15 minutes long; I love this
genre ^^). On one hand, it's somewhat jarring. But on the other, as ever with
WLTS, boy does it ever nicely set the tone for the rest of the album's
"journey".

That's not to say that there aren't nice tracks on the album, far from it! The
remaining half of the first track is softer (although the opening harshness does
make a comeback towards the end of the track), and this is a common theme
throughout the album. There are some soft tracks in the middle of it, but most
of the tracks blend post-rock and that more metal-y harshness; the album tells a
tragic, haunting narrative, and the music reflects that. It's actually really
cool.

I love this album, I genuinely do, but the intensity of its story, how the music
tells it, and the at times overwhelming soundscape means it is not something I
listen to lightly, in the background. And I often need to just sit for a bit
after listening to it. It's a tragic story, but it's just so well done...

Reading back over that. If I've somehow convinced you to listen to this because
it is actually fantastic music, rather than you just going "I'm good. Do you
need a hug?", then yay!  ^^

Also, be sure to listen to the combination of the album's poem/story and the
track "Dust", on YouTube: "Triumph & Disaster - Are we really too late?" This
combination is not included on the album (I don't know why, it is genuinely a
shame), but it is once again really well done and sets the tone for the album.


## Video Games

TODO: All of the below

### Sayonara Wild Hearts

So. Much. Raw. Fun.

Riddles are a bit too hard imo.

Over 10 hours in a game that's effectively a 1-hour interactive album. It's
good ^^

### Celeste

Not technically from this year, but I returned to it this year and not only did
a full run, but earned 100% of its achievements.
So challenging. So damn fun. (I did Chapter 9 again, just because it flows so
well and blends story, music, and gameplay _exquisitely_!). 100 hours almost...

### Hades

Wanted to like this. I've enjoyed previous Supergiant games. Found final boss
somewhat arbitrary in difficulty (but maybe I just need to git gud).

### Deep Rock Galactic

**Rock and Stone!**


## Books

### Becky Chambers' books

Some years ago, a friend of mine recommended the first of the Becky Chambers
books: "The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet". I picked it up around Christmas
that year, read it in (I think) a day, and _immediately_ turned it over and
re-read it; it was that good.

It was sci-fi like I had never read before: intrictate, and with detailed
characters; amazing dialogue and interactions; refreshingly diverse species (as
in, not "Oh look! In this Milky Way of ours with literally billions of stars,
somehow every species is humanoid."); plot, scheming, secrets; glimpses of
technological and scientific explosions that were so cool and interesting, yet
didn't seem completely magic (for lack of a better term) or illogical. There's
also small sprinkles of anthropology throughout the books, and it makes for
highly entertaining musings on what "normal" is, in an intergalactic commons
context.

It's not a space opera; nobody is The Chosen One, destined to save the universe
(tm). That might put some people off, and that's fair. But I personally found it
incredibly refreshing, and all the more enjoyable, to read and experience the
story of humans and aliens, and their interactions, that still felt relatable
and humane. The plot, conflicts, relationships, interactions, etc.  weren't
grandiose; and yet they were. (Much in the same way as life, I guess.)

Anyway. I have since picked up each of the "Wayfarer" novels (of which "The Long
Way [...]" is the first), and although they are (mostly) independent and with
different casts, they are all a wonderfully... cosy-whilst-thrilling, I think
I'll call it. And each one brings something fresh, a new idea / a new
plot-point, meaning I never felt like the stories were boring or "simply"
expanding on existing story for the sake of it.

Chambers' novella "Monk and Robot"-series are her more recent books, set in a
more solarpunk kind of world. But there are fun new religions (like one whose
symbol is a bear eating honey, and the religion is focused on comfort and good
food), an interesting world to explore along with thoughts on AI, mortality, and
(indirectly) the meaning of life. Delightfully Zen.

At this point, I will pick up anything she publishes without hesitation, and
they're my go-to books for a nice afternoon in on a rainy day  : )

### The House of Sorrowing Stars (Beth Cartwright)

Personally found it disappointing. Lots of good ideas, but not quite put
together into a satisfying story.
Instalove is not my thing and felt misplaced? awkward?

### Monstress (Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda)

Okay, this one I've technically been following for 7 years, but I picked up
"Volume 8: Inferno" last month and it just continues to be excellent. The art is
gorgeous, with clear inspiration from the Jugenstil/Art Nouveau movement, mixed
with a healthy amount of Steam Punk, but that wouldn't matter too much if the
story wasn't good. If you hadn't guessed, it thankfully is. We've got political
plots, intrigue, and mystique, spread between a religious cult, immortal
demi-gods from an unknown world, talking cats with multiple tails (and
warrior-poets!), humans, and "arcanics", which are children of the humans and
the demi-gods. But no faction is perfect either, there are internal conflicts,
corruption, all that good stuff that makes for really nice and deep storytelling
about a world in a post-war, delicate state.

It also has one of the aspects I respect enormously in a story, especially one
set in a plotting, post-war, grim world: it doesn't shy away from hurting its
cast or characters. Battles are fought, sieges are laid, sabotages are
conducted, and never is it "And the heroes made it because they're the heroes."
or "And the cute ones were unscathed because war never affects the innocent."
The fights are fair and realistic, with every dirty trick you would expect from
highly powerful, definitely-not-quite-at-war factions applied, and if the main
character would lose a limb, they do. Characters which were introduced but run
into an infernal monster? They get killed by said monster. And I respect that.

It also deals very nicely, in my opinion, with the mental state of its
characters and how that changes based on the events that they encounter. I'm
looking forward to see where the story gets taken now that it seems it's
potentially reached the endgame.

### The Infinity Particle (Wendy Xu)

On a completely different note to Monstress, "The Infinity Particle" is a strong
recommend to anyone who's familiar with the Becky Chambers novels and want
_more_. It's a sweet, but short, story set in a near-ish future on Mars. About a
tech intern, a human-like sentient robot, and narcissism (okay, that part is not
sweet, but it is key to the story). There are many interesting little thoughts
about what a world with conscious AI would be like, mutual respect in
relationships both platonic and non, as well as power structures. I think it
might be aimed at more of a young-adult audience, but it scratched that "cosy
space sci-fi" itch for me  ^^

### The Three-Body Problem and The Dark Forest (Cixin Liu)

TODO: I have mixed feelings about these. But they're generally good I think.


### Others

I enjoyed these, and miraculously even had time to write a bit more about it.

* [N.K. Jemisin's "Broken Earth Trilogy"](/TODO)
* [The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern](/TODO)
