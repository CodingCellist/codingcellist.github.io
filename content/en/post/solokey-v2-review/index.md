## Intro

SoloKey makes open-source and open-hardware security keys Ã  la YubiKey, with the
latest iteration being the v2. I always think it is cool when people manage to
make open-source profitable, and had been looking to get security keys for a
while, so when the Solo v2 (aka. Solo2) launched on Kickstarter, I was eager to
support it. It took a while to arrive but it seems to work well, although the
software is in its early stages and the documentation needs improving.


## Kickstarter and shipping issues

The Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in late February 2021, with an
estimated delivery window of April-June 2021. Now, delays are almost inevitable
with crowd-funded projects, especially ones launched during the pandemic (with
the shipping crisis, semiconductor shortage, etc.). Even so, I had almost given
up on ever receiving the keys.

There had been numerous set-backs and problems discovered, the most egregious
necessitating a redesign of the hardware and acquiring a new production machine
(which then later needed an add-on to solve a process bottleneck). It quickly
became clear that the original delivery window was unfeasible. And, to be fair,
SoloKey admitted this. Still, the delivery experience wasn't good.

I received an email with a shipping number from Leetronics (SoloKey's European
contractor) on the 19th of April 2022. I occasionally checked this, but there
were never any updates besides "we will receive a shipment and deliver it to
you". After a couple of months, I had completely forgotten about it, until I
suddenly got a package notification, around the _14th of October_ 2022. This was
5 months after the shipping number was created, 4 months after the
["we'll get to it by the end of June"-promise](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/conorpatrick/solo-v2-safety-net-against-phishing/posts/3484043),
and just under 3 months after the
["it will be a few more weeks"-update](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/conorpatrick/solo-v2-safety-net-against-phishing/posts/3561679).
I'm happy I got the keys and that they work, but the delivery experience was not
good, even for a Kickstarter project.

(There was never an update to the original shipping number by the way. It still
just says "The sender has announced that this item will be delivered to Deutsche
Post on April 19, 2022.", despite it being several months after delivery...)
