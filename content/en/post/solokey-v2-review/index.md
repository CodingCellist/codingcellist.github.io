## Intro

SoloKey makes open-source and open-hardware security keys Ã  la YubiKey, with the
latest iteration being the v2. I always think it is cool when people manage to
make open-source profitable, and had been looking to get security keys for a
while, so when the SoloKey v2 (aka. Solo v2) launched on Kickstarter, I was
eager to support it. It took a while to arrive but it seems to work well,
although the software is in its early stages and the documentation needs
improving.


## Kickstarter and shipping issues

The Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in late February 2021, with an
estimated delivery window of April-June 2021. Now, delays are almost inevitable
with crowd-funded projects, especially ones launched during the pandemic (with
the shipping crisis, semiconductor shortage, etc.). Even so, I had almost given
up on ever receiving the keys.

There had been numerous set-backs and problems discovered, the most egregious
necessitating a redesign of the hardware and acquiring a new production machine
(which then later needed an add-on to solve a process bottleneck). It quickly
became clear that the original delivery window was unfeasible. And, to be fair,
SoloKey admitted this. Nevertheless...

I received an email with a shipping number from Leetronics (SoloKey's European
contractor) on the 19th of April 2022. I occasionally checked this, but there
were never any updates besides "we will receive a shipment and deliver it to
you". After a couple of months, I had completely forgotten about it, until I
suddenly got a package notification, around the _14th of October_ 2022. This was
5 months after the shipping number was created, 4 months after the
["we'll get to it by the end of June"-promise](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/conorpatrick/solo-v2-safety-net-against-phishing/posts/3484043),
and just under 3 months after the
["it will be a few more weeks"-update](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/conorpatrick/solo-v2-safety-net-against-phishing/posts/3561679).
I'm happy I got the keys and that they work, but the delivery experience was not
good, even for a Kickstarter project.

(There was never an update to the original shipping number by the way. It still
just says "The sender has announced that this item will be delivered to Deutsche
Post on April 19, 2022.", despite it being several months after delivery...)


## Packaging and Initial Impressions

Opening the parcel, the packing is very minimal. Each key is packed in a small
cardboard "envelope" that feels nice and seems sturdy enough to protect the
contents. Unfortunately, it is not the easiest to open: the perforation could be
better and I often ended up undoing the glue rather than the perforation, unless
I took care to snap every perforated tab one at a time. (It also doesn't help
that the stickers are big and often cover the perforated lines.)

<TODO: Image of perforation>

Besides the keys, there is also a really neat business-card with the schematics
for the reversible USB-A connector. This looks great, and is also ties in well
with their Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) aim/philosophy.

<TODO: Image of card>

Moving on to the keys themselves, the Limited Edition (LE) was the first one I
opened and it looks cool! The purple is a nice colour, and the traces are nicely
visible as well. However, the resin/epoxy that they used to seal the PCB looks
bubbly, as if the air didn't escape when drying (or perhaps its just the
glitter; it is hard to tell (and even harder to photograph)...) 

<TODO: Image of LE with bubbly resin>

Compare this with the resin on the normal Solo v2:

<TODO: Image of non-LE>

Turning over the key, we get my favourite detail: a little bee on the back of
every key!!

<TODO: Image of BEE!>

Comparing the USB-C with USB-A, the biggest difference is that the USB-C sticks
out/tilts a bit. This is possibly just how the USB-C connector is attached to
the PCB, it is taller than the USB-A connector after all, but it looks a bit
odd.

<TODO: Image of USB-C tilt>

I'm always fan of customisation, so I ordered a bunch of cases to try out. They
are relatively easy to put on; it doesn't feel like the cases or the key will
break when putting them on. SoloKey do include some cases with the keys, so the
extra colours are optional. The included cases are slightly different: they have
a small round dip in the case for easier grip.

<TODO: Image of the cases?>

With the cases applied, another thing I had noticed becomes even more obvious:
there is a _healthy_ dollop of resin on the LEs. I am not sure if this was
because of the glittery resin being less viscous than the transparent one or if
this is only my two LEs (I doubt it), and it doesn't really affect anything, but
it seems a bit weird that these got so much resin compared to the other keys.

<TODO: Image of the chonky LEs>

With the keys looking nice, it was time to try them out. But first I decided to
update the firmware, to make sure everything was as recent (and hence hopefully
error-free) as possible.


## Updating the firmware on Windows


N.B.: In this section I will be making a lot of comments on how user-friendly
this process would be for the non-developer/average user. While I know the
people buying OSHW security tokens probably aren't just your average user, it is
not impossible. There is also a difference between being computer-savvy and
knowing how to install various toolchains and how to navigate a Command Line
Interface (CLI). Finally, if the goal is wide(r)-spread adoption of these
devices (similar to YubiCo's stuff), then it is crucial that the user manuals
are comprehensible to everyone.

With that out of the way...

The first thing I did to update the firmware was to go looking for instructions
for how to do this. The quick-start guide
([solokey.com/start](https://solokey.com/start))
has a link for how to update the firmware on Windows, perfect! However, this
guide doesn't inspire the most confidence: there are minor spelling mistakes
("than" vs "then") which makes it seem rushed, and the phrase "[it] appears
complicated to the non-developer" means it will likely be borderline impossible
and/or terrifying for the average user to follow. But the biggest hurdle is the
pre-requisite to even getting started: since the firmware is written in Rust, we
need to install Rust to update it. And installing Rust, it turns out, is not
simple at all...

### Installing Rust on Windows

The guide points to "rustup", which presents the option of 32- or 64-bit, with
32-bit selected as the default. This is already too high a barrier in my
opinion, although the 32-bit version should work on all machines (but not
everyone knows that, or even know what architecture they're running).

A bigger problem is that the rustup installer immediately differs from the
provided guide: the guide suggests I should get a prompt for installing Rust,
but instead it complains about a lack of Microsoft compilers and points to
installing Visual Studio (VS), Microsoft's Integrated Development Environment
(IDE). Neither rustup nor the guide explains why this might be required.

<TODO: Image of differing prompts?>

I begrudgingly follow the link and download the VS installer. Here, I only
encounter more confusion (even as a developer): do I need the Windows 10/11
developer kit? Do I need to log in to VS? Because logging into VS is the next
thing I'm prompted for. It turns out the respective answers are "Yes" and "No":
you can install VS and its compilers without using VS ever. Frustrated, I spent
some time trying to find a smoother approach, e.g. using `winget`, but _the only
way_ to install Microsoft's compiler collection is via the VS installer! That's
atrocious, but I'm getting off-topic.

Finally, after not installing VS but using its installer to install a different
set of tools, I re-run the rustup installer and get the same prompt as in the
guide. Now we're at square 1 of the _precursor_ to updating the firmware; that's
not great.

The install proceeds without problems, but at the end of the process Rust
informs me that I may need to update the `PATH`. I happen to know what `PATH` is
and how to change it, but I'm a computer science professional! I seriously doubt
the average user would be able to change it (and even if they found a guide,
they might be worried about touching something so technical). Anyway, let's
continue on with the guide.

### Updating the firmware (finally)

The next step is to run `cmd.exe`, use `cargo install solo2` to install
SoloKey's command line tool `solo2`, and then check that the `solo2` program
works correctly. Fortunately, this goes without any problems!

<TODO: Image of things working>

Finally, we can try to update the firmware: `solo2 update`. This warns me that
the update is major and will break previous credentials, but also includes a
note saying that if the key has not been used yet, then I can ignore the
warning. Explicitly stating this is excellent and helps resolve fears if you're
not a tech-savvy user.

<TODO: Image of warning?>

The update seems to run flawlessly, with the key being registered a couple of
time by Windows during the update (expected behaviour), and a quick check
afterwards confirms that everything went fine.
