This idea came to me randomly today: I keep a notebook of blog-post and project
ideas, and it might be neat and fun to visualise these. Now I forget who it was,
but I saw a different tech (I think it was tech) blog which had these garden
annotations on their articles. So articles would evolve from seeds to sprouts to
plants, the idea being that maintaining a blog was like maintaining a little
online garden. I _think_ that also included the plants withering over time,
which I'm not so keen on; most posts don't need constant updating imo (and I
certainly don't have the time for it). But I really like the metaphor.

What is the idea then? The idea is to create some sort of Trello-like board,
whose layout is generated from a list of future projects. The visualisation
would contain patches of "soil" for ideas to populate, and as they move from the
"todo/potential" section to "in-progress" to "complete", they would move
location in the garden and grow into different plants. I could maybe even do
something fun like having little plant signs for the different tags/categories,
but let's get an MVP going first.

plants in them, and signs above columns of plants labelled TODO,
IN-PROGRESS, and DONE. All drawn in purple

~~I have no idea what I'm going to make this in. Probably some sort of JS-based
thing, although who knows what. I'll update this post with some sketches and
considerations for tools+frameworks once I've looked into that.~~ Update from
2023-11-16: I had a look at various libraries and
[P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
seems to be the best balance between ease-of-use and design freedom, so that's
where that's at.

I'd like to play around with pixel art, and procedurally generated
plants/saplings/branches and gravel paths. We'll see how it goes. For now I'm
just putting this out here so I actually do it and not just leave it in my
notebook. I really ~~should be writing my thesis~~ want something fun like this
to exist, and I think it could be an interesting project. So hopefully by
putting this up on my site, I'll actually do it  ^^

And once it is done, maybe that will get me to finish all those other posts and
ideas I've had for (in some cases literally) years...

Anyway, that's all folks. Hope it was interesting to read, maybe it even sparked
some ideas of your own. In any case, thanks for reading and have a great day  : )

### CHANGELOG

* 2023-12-10: Finally uploaded the further ideation I did only 4 days after
    writing the original post...

(Here's the full notebook brainstorm, in case that's interesting. Ink is Pantone
Colour of the Year  <3):
