Well, there we go. Just shy of four years after I started my PhD, I've finally
submitted a research paper to a workshop. In this case: "The Workshop on
Type-Driven Development" -- abbreviated TyDe -- 2024. Papers aren't a
requirement for passing your PhD here (and I know several successful people
who never did as part of their PhD), but it still feels good to at least have
submitted something (I'm _so_ not counting my chickens yet!). The title of it is
"Type-level Property Based Testing".

It's always interesting to go through the motions yourself, having heard from
others what it is like. I was convinced I could have it all ready one month
before the submission deadline. In reality, it ended up being closer to 5 days
before (which apparently is really good, I'm told the day before is horrifyingly
normal). I would love to write more about it, if my brain doesn't immediately
repress it due to the past week of stress, but I'm currently slightly tired of
writing...  ^^;;

Also, past me turned out to be a turned out to be a huge help! I keep a series
of PhD notebooks of technical considerations, paper summaries, miscellaneous
ramblings, etc. As part of that, about a year ago, I took care to keep a log of
all the tricks and challenges involved with implementing what I ended up writing
about. All the challenges and considerations were there (albeit in note form)
and I "just" needed to transfer them into formal writing. Thanks past me!!

Of course, my supervisor was also a great help. The initial version was 1Â½ pages
over the 12 page limit; 3 columns too many. But like many things, experience is
helpful, and so Edwin managed to regain those columns by "simply" rewording
things (and cutting some excessive details I didn't know were excessive). This
was a massive help, and I would not have been able to submit without it.

After a tiny amount of confusion, I have now received confirmation that the
paper is not meant to be anonymous or double-blind or anything like that, hence
this blog post, where you'll also find the paper itself (the PDF should be
linked at the top of this page). We're not entirely happy with the title, but it
was the best we could come up with (and naming is infamously one of the 2
hardest Computer Science problems, so I'm glad we have a title at all  ^^). I
will update the paper once the review process has happened. Oh also, although
it's slightly distracting, I think I have to put this somewhere: **the PDF is a
personal copy for personal use only, not redistribution**, it is pre-everything,
including peer review.

Regardless of whether you read or understand any of it, I hope you at least
enjoyed this tiny random blurb  : )

I would like to do a more comprehensive discussion/walkthrough/tutorial about
how and what I did in the paper, but apparently that's called a "Thesis Chapter"
and "something I really should be working on right now". (Oh yeah, this is also
why
[the graph](../writing-up-a-phd)
has been flat for the past while. I'm really looking forward to the jump once I
add this in!).

Anyway, I'm off to
[EMF](https://emfcamp.org)
tomorrow -- the timing worked out _so well_ -- which I'm looking forward to
tremendously (5 years I've wanted to go to that! _\*shakes fist at COVID\*_).
It'll also be the only tiny amount of summer holiday I get this year, but such
is writing up it seems. Thanks again for reading, bye for now  : )
