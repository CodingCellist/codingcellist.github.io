As of today, 2023-06-30, my Reddit account (u/CodingCellist) has been deleted
due to the ongoing controversy with API pricing and third-party apps. I'm aware
this is a drop in the ocean or something, and I was genuinely sad to see my
account go, but sometimes that's just how things be. I meant to leave the
comments up in an edited state, but accidentally misconfigured the tool I was
using so it edited _and_ deleted everything.  
*sigh*  
Remember to read the docs and double-check your configs people!

Some of the content was cross-posts from here anyway, but for the stuff that
wasn't, I did as best as I could this month to archive it on the Internet
Archive aka. Wayback Machine. Should anyone ever need it, it can be (slowly)
browsed there via my `old [dot] reddit [dot] com` user link.

So long and thanks for all the fish, Reddit.


As for where I'll be now, I don't know. IRC and Discord I guess? Time will tell.
