I am coming up on the end of my allotted time for my PhD and need to write up.
There is little content of this follow-along-journal-kind out there (as far as I
know), so I thought it might be interesting to document, if nothing else for
myself to look back over someday. I'll update this from time to time, either
when something big happens or changes, or when I feel I should add a bit
(probably around once per week). Fair warning: this will likely become rambling
and incohesive as the stress increases, and for this I ask you to please be
understanding.

Welcome to the slow-motion train wreck! Enjoy!

* Supervisor meeting with details for what next
* Not to worry about not having published. That will come with the write-up
    (hopefully).
* Need to get my example working with sequences of operations, but then I'm
    good!
* And then I can start writing.
* Speaking of: we put together a rough plan for what chapters there will be
  - TODO: Photo of this
  - "Hey, I think we're actually gonna make it!"
