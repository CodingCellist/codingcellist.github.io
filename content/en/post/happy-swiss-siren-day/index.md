So I am currently visiting Switzerland, happily sitting in a caf√© and coding
away. All is nice and well. Except. In the distance looms a menacing shadow:
It's the first Wednesday of February... If you, like me, have not grown up in
Switzerland (or lived there for some time), you'd be forgiven for thinking this
is just a normal Wednesday like any other. But _oh boy_, how wrong you'd be!...

At about 13:30, an ear-piercing screech cuts through the air.

A year ago, when I was also visiting Switzerland, I was sitting in my SO's flat
when the same thing happened. Except, because the flat is quite well-insulated (and the
windows were closed due to it being February), the same screech was a lot more
quiet... My first thought was "Huh, that sounds almost like air-raid sirens. But
I must be wrong; why would something like that be going off?" Only for me to
open the window and discover that, yes, those were, in fact, air-raid-like
sirens. Sounding all around the city.

If you've seen enough movies, or played enough video games, the sound is
unmistakeable and hearing it in the real world, in what you know is not some
form of fiction or entertainment, immediately instills a feeling of dread. My
first reaction was to check various world news sites, just to check whether WW3
had somehow suddenly broken out. When that didn't seem to be the case (and I
started getting the adrenaline under control) I noticed that literally nobody
else down on the street below seemed concerned. Either they'd made their peace
with the impending doom a long time ago, or there was something I was missing.
Assuming it was most likely the latter, I tried looking at local the local news,
but no luck there either. Finally, I did an online search for "Switzerland air
sirens" (in retrospect, I probably should've done that a lot sooner in the
process) and found a perfectly reasonable explanation on an online forum. I
laughed a bit at the wave of relief that washed over me, and continued going
about my day only _slightly_ shaken.

It turns out that every year, on the first Wednesday of February, the Swiss test
all their sirens. There are 2 types of these: flood sirens and general sirens.
Testing these is, of course, an entirely reasonable thing to do when you have so
many rivers, lakes, bunkers, precautionary military measures, several nuclear
power plants, and **lots of sirens**. However, as far as I can tell, there is
_no_ announcement or news or warning or **anything** that this will be
happening! Everyone "just knows" (tm). So if you, like me, have never been in
Switzerland at just the right time and are just innocently going about your day
like it's any other, you get quite the nasty shock...

A year later, I now know to expect the sirens when I'm visiting in February. But
it's still an eerie sound, and I don't think I'm going to get used to it anytime
soon...

(Oh, and since you're probably curious as to what it sounds like, here you go!)
