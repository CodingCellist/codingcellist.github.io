I needed a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) for a project I was working on.
And Idris _does_ come with that built-in: `System.Random`. Except, its
functionality lives in the `IO` world and my project involved stuff working at
the type-level, which doesn't do `IO` (because having the compiler be able to
arbitrary I/O is probably a bad idea). So I needed to write my own.

It didn't need to be good, this was for a proof-of-concept, and I'd heard that
ChatGPT was decent for simple single-use code, so I thought I might as well try
it. It turned out _pretty good:_

Sensible first response, but it has the problem with using `IO`. Let's try being
more specific:

Ah... This is a common problem with ChatGPT: it will happily make up modules and
APIs as need be. There is no `mt` module. But that's okay, we can just ask it to
help write something like that. At this point I _had_ skimmed a paper on PRNGs,
meaning I knew the words "Merkle-DamgÃ¥rd construction", but not what they meant.

Now we're getting somewhere! But where did those magic numbers come from?...

Neat! Now to correct the syntax errors:

It's not right about the `shl` function, it _is_ actually just `shiftL`, but
that's a simple fix. Now, I would like to stick this in a repository, so I'll
need a README. I _could_ write this myself, but hey we're having fun with this
anyway, so how far can we get?

Fine, but I'd like to be more copy-pasteable:

Now that's nice! I'm not super comfortable with the phrase about taking full
responsibility for the implementation and any errors though. This code should
_definitely_ not be used for anything serious!...

Much better! At this point, I had also tried pasting the code into an Idris file
and as a result, had gotten a complaint from the compiler: `PRNGState` has the
constructor `PRNGState`. ChatGPT is using Haskell syntax (which makes sense,
given that there is more Haskell than Idris out there so Haskell's syntax is the
statistically more likely when generating the next word).

Now that's pretty cool, it also updated the calls and pattern-matches! But the
`compress` function still looks magic to me:

Right. ChatGPT is trained on existing text, including code, so in cases where
there is a common way to implement a thing, it makes sense that it copied one of
those. That should probably be cited:

Now here's where I got over-excited and forgot what I was dealing with: that
link is plausible and so I happily put it in the code. I have since reverted
that commit because the link doesn't actually point anywhere. The user and repo
are real, but the path to the file is wrong. The correct link is:

[https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT/blob/master/tinymt/tinymt32.h](https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT/blob/master/tinymt/tinymt32.h)

However, this is still wrong, because it turns out the file _doesn't contain the
constants_. So the reference is made up, insofar as it doesn't contain what
ChatGPT claims it does, and where the magic constants actually are taken from is
anyone's guess...

Anyway, remember how I said `shl` doesn't exist? Why refactor manually when you
can ask ChatGPT to do so?

Here it hasn't actually "learnt" anything, it has just taken my correction as
the ground truth. Which is fine for corrections in programs, but it does assume
the correction you've given ChatGPT is actually correct.

At this stage, I was enthusing with a friend about the generated results. I was
thoroughly impressed that it could write Idris (subject to some corrections, but
still), and even more so that the code actually seemed to work! My friend asked
a great question: "If it can do this, what about Agda, which has mixfix
operators?".

I know very little Agda, and have never used it, so I didn't know. But wait!
Given that ChatGPT wrote the code, would it know? It definitely would have at
least as good an understanding of Agda's syntax as I did; probably better
actually!

Impressive! I couldn't check it since I don't have Agda installed, but I sent it
back to my friend, who said it looked plausible! How cool is that??

To try to wrap things up, I asked it to add a note to the disclaimer about the
fact that I am not a cryptography expert:

That wasn't quite what I asked: it had specified that _ChatGPT_ wasn't a
cryptography expert, not that I, Thomas, was not. And for some reason it seems
to have lost the ability to use markdown formatting: 'DISCLAIMER' should be a
heading. But it still works, I just need to reword it a tiny bit.

I tried to get it to improve my working version of the code, but it struggled
with names, `let`-bindings, and `where`-blocks. It mostly ran in circles or
changed the code when it was meant to only be renaming variables. It's not super
interesting to look at...

Lua-formatted?? That's just completely wrong, but the code itself seems fine. I
would prefer it to use `where`-blocks though:

Now it's SQL-formatted. Seemingly ChatGPT has lost the context for what language
we're using and is just guessing. That's interesting. I also interrupted this
response since it was no longer using the code I had given it.

{{</ spoiler >}}

Rather than getting it to reformat my code, I decided to ask it to write the
function I needed: generating a list of `n` random numbers. This it handled
without any problems:

It would be really nice if this could be total though.

Isn't that cool?? It not only understood the pattern-matching on `Nat`s and how
it affects the number, it even included the `_` wildcard for the first case, and
used a readable `let`-binding for the recursive one!

Going mad with power, I decided to try to teach it linearity. Unfortunately that
didn't work:

This is not only syntactically wrong, but also an infinite loop: `newState`
calls `update` which calls `newState` etc. The totality checker immediately
spotted this and complained.

Ah well, move on to something less cool but more practical:

> [ChatGPT] We can use the random function to generate a 32-bit integer and then divide it by the maximum 32-bit unsigned integer value (i.e. 2^32 - 1). This will give us a floating-point number in the range [0, 1). Here's an example implementation:

It's made up `Bits.toDouble`, but other than that it's sensible code. And it
even explained how it works, which I greatly appreciated! Time to tell it how to
fix things:

It got a number of things wrong. Most notably the application of `cast` and the
existence of a Python-like power operator.

The `cast` on the max integer value is excessive due to it being a
`Double`-literal, but other than that this is much better.

Not having learnt my lesson, I tried to get it to refactor the code to be nicer
(e.g. storing magic numbers in variables with descriptive names).

More made-up power operators...

Once again, back to practical things: lists of random doubles.

Now I have everything I need, and I barely had to write any code!!

I think this technology is _super_ cool. Especially for things where you only
need a proof-of-concept, one-time script, or even (as in this case) a
reimplementation of something existing and well-known. As I made sure it put
many times in various disclaimers, this shouldn't be used for anything serious
since I do not have the knowledge to confirm its correctness and/or robustness,
but it saved me a lot of time and was a lot more fun than writing the code by
hand.

For the syntax errors, a really interesting question is what would happen if
someone hooked ChatGPT up to the type-checker so that it had access to the
typing information and error messages as part of its output-generation? However,
that sounds very much like a research project on its own, and I don't need more
of those... If anyone has a go at it though, please let me know what happens!

Finally, it costs nothing to be polite. ChatGPT was extremely helpful and
patient after all:

> [TH] This has been amazing! Thank you so much for your help!!

> [ChatGPT] You're very welcome! It was my pleasure to help. If you have any
> more questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask.

And that concludes this little adventure. Thanks for reading, I hope it was
interesting!  : )
