I am currently doing a PhD in Computer Science on
[something along the lines of combining Type Theory and Formal Methods](../files/phd-proposal.pdf)
(although this may change over the course of the project), supervised by
[Dr Edwin Brady](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/). I enjoy writing code,
collaborating on projects, and helping people write or fix code. 

When I'm not doing PhD things, I do Japanese Jujitsu (or rather 'did', in the
Before Times) and occasionally play the cello. I enjoy music, hiking and
camping, as well as a wide variety of video games, both old and new.
