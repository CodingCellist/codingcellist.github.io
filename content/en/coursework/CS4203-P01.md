First practical done as part of CS4203 "Computer Security", which I took during
my 5th year. The aim of the practical was to write a report describing what
blockchain is and how it works, along with 2 separate areas of research or
commercial interest. The description of the separate areas had to discuss
functionality, current and potential applications, and security concerns or
problems.

In addition to the above, the practical was to be done in a style of an
industrial report to a line manager who was aware of cryptography and general
computer security, but who might not have been aware of current trends, tools,
or techniques.

My submission achieved a grade of 19.0/20.
