My MSci project was on DVFS, energy savings, and scheduling in Assymetric
Multicore Processors (AMPs), and was done using the [gem5](https://gem5.org)
simulator. The project was done full-time in one semester of the, without any
other courses going on at the same time. CS5199 is a special Individual Masters
Project for students doing an Integrated Masters (MSci) degree.

Due to problems with gem5's stats model being redone without much documentation,
and the documentation being out-of-date for a lot of ARM and DVFS simulation,
the project had to be simplified to a purely hypothetical exploration of the
ideas, without attempting to implement them in a scheduler.

The project achieved a final grade of 16.5/20.

(at a later date, I wrote up my notes on gem5 and contributed the following 2
pages of documentation as a help for future users:
- [ARM Power Modelling](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/part2/arm_power_modelling/)
- [ARM DVFS Modelling](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/part2/arm_dvfs_support/)
