Second practical done as part of CS4202 "Computer Architecture", which I took in
my SH/4th year. The aim of this practical was to gain experience with computer
architecture concepts by exploring compiler optimisations, to be able to reason
about the effect of compiler optimisations on certain program fragments, and to
develop and use a test-suite for conducting compiler optimisation tests.

The practical was split into 2 parts: Part 1 involved exploring the effect of
4-5 GCC compiler optimisations on C program code. Part 2 involved manually
implementing the optimisations/program transformations, and then compare the
results (being careful to turn the relevant compiler optimisations off).

My submission obtained a grade of 19.0/20.
