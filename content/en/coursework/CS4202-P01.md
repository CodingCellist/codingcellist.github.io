First practical done as part of CS4202 "Computer Architecture", which I took in
my SH/4th year. The aim of this practical was to gain an understanding of
different branch prediction strategies for particular programs, along with their
importance, and to develop and demonstrate scientific experimentation and
analysis techniques. This had to be done by writing a branch predictor simulator
capable of simulating various different branch prediction strategies,
calculating the misprediction rates, taking a program trace generated by Intel's

tool.

My submission achieved a grade of 17.5/20.
