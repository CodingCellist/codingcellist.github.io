Second practical done as part of CS4203 "Computer Security", which I
took during my 5th year. The aims of this practical were to 1) use passive
pen-testing tools to investigate two websites, and 2) to conduct an "alpha
(self-tested)" study into using keystroke timings as a potential biometric
authentication factor. We were informed that part of the exercise was also to
approach the study in an academic manner, i.e. including relevant citations,
acknowledging shortcomings and limitations, and suggesting improvements and/or
further work.

My submission achieved a grade of 18.0/20.
