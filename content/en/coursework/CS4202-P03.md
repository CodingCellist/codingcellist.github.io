Third practical done as part of CS4202 "Computer Architecture", which I took in
my SH/4th year. The aim of the practical was to explore a computer architecture
paper on a topic of interest, either old or cutting-edge, and prepare a
presentation on it. I chose to explore Simultaneous Multi-Threading
(aka. "Hyperthreading" on Intel CPUs).

My presentation achieved a mark of 18.0/20.
