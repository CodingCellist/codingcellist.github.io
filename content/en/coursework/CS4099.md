My SH project was done in Idris 1 and involved parts of the [TeamPlay
project](https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu/). The Senior Honours Project is a
project usually done at the end of a BSc degree. However, it used to also be
possible to do it as part of an MSci degree, allowing students to have
experience before doing the MSci project or to potentially finish a year early
with a BSc instead. The project is done continuously over both semesters, along
with other coursework.

The SH project ended up deviating a bit from the title and initial objectives
due to turbulence caused by my initial supervisor (not the person on the report)
being fired because of trying to cover up a very serious case of plagiarism they
had committed.

The project achieved a final grade of 17.0/20.
