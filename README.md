# personal-website

Hello there :)

This is the repo of my [personal website](https://teh6.eu). It mostly just
contains a bit of background info, my public key, and the occasional blog entry.

I originally considered building this myself, but between wanting EN+DA support,
wanting things to look nice on mobile (because most people seem to view websites
on mobile these days), and not wanting to faff about too much with CSS, I
decided to just use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It seemed fast and reasonably
easy to set up, and has worked fine for my use-case so far. That being said, I
_have_ made a couple of adjustments to the CSS to get things exactly like I
wanted them. I guess you can't quite escape it ^^.
